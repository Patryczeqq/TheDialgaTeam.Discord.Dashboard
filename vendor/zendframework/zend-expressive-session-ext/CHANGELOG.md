# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, in reverse chronological order by release.

## 1.1.1 - 2018-05-14

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#21](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-session-ext/pull/21) fixes a situation whereby during persistence, if no identifier existed for
  the session, it was not persisted. Such situations would occur when a new session was created, as
  no identifier would yet exist. It now properly generates an identifier and persists the data in
  such cirumstances.

## 1.1.0 - 2018-05-10

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- [#12](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-session-ext/pull/12) updates the `PhpSessionPersistence` class such that it is now responsible for
  emitting the various cache limiter headers (`Expires`, `Cache-Control`, `Last-Modified`, and `Pragma`) normally
  emitted by ext-session and controlled by the `session.cache_limiter` and `session.cache_expire` INI settings.
  This approach ensures that those headers are not overwritten by ext-session if set elsewhere in your
  application.

- [#9](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-session-ext/pull/9) swaps a call to `session_commit` to `session_write_close` withing `PhpSessionPersistence`,
  as the former is an alias for the latter.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.
